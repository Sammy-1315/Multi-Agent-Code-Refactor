# Multi-Agent-Code-Refactor

**Multi-Agent-Code-Refactor** is a local, microservices-based system designed to optimize code files through multi-agent technology. Each agent in the system is specialized for a specific aspect of code improvement, including performance enhancement, security hardening, and adherence to coding style guidelines. By distributing responsibilities across multiple agents, the system can analyze and refactor large codebases efficiently and with precision.

The architecture leverages microservices to isolate individual components, making the system modular, scalable, and easy to maintain. Agents communicate seamlessly to identify issues, suggest improvements, and automatically apply refactorings where appropriate. This approach ensures that code quality is consistently high without introducing regressions or vulnerabilities.

## Key Features

- **Performance Optimization:** Detects inefficient algorithms, redundant operations, and potential bottlenecks.  
- **Security Improvements:** Identifies vulnerabilities, unsafe patterns, and suggests safe alternatives.  
- **Style and Maintainability:** Enforces best practices, consistent formatting, and readability improvements.  
- **Extensibility:** New agents can be added for additional checks or domain-specific refactorings without affecting existing functionality.  

This tool is ideal for developers, teams, or organizations looking to automate the tedious aspects of code quality improvement while maintaining full control in a local environment.
